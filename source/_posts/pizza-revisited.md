<p>I love pizza and I now have a recipe for a base that does not involve hunting down cauliflower, taking a bank loan to buy them, then steaming them and squeezing the shit out of them before being able to even start the base.</p>
<p>I also battle to get the right taste for my tomato topping so I decided to cut it out altogether and used cream cheese as a topping to the base. Decidedly un-Italian but oh so delicious. This pairs very well with pink salmon, grated mozzarella and some spring onions, which gives you a good dose of those anti-inflammatory omega 3’s.</p>
<p>The base recipe is courtesy of Kristie Sullivan, PHD, who began her low-carb journey in 2013 after a lifetime struggle with obesity. It was the only thing that worked for her and she has since published a book of everyday low-carb recipes “Journey to Health: A Journey Worth Taking”.</p>
<p>She also has a YouTube channel, Cooking Keto with Kristie.</p>
<p>Here is how to make the base:</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>½ cup whey isolate unflavored protein powder</p>
<p>½ teaspoon baking powder</p>
<p>½ teaspoon granulated garlic (garlic powder)</p>
<p>½ teaspoon salt</p>
<p>½ teaspoon Italian seasoning (I just used mixed herbs)</p>
<p>85 grams grated parmesan cheese (if you don’t have just up the mozzarella)</p>
<p>85 grams mozzarella cheese</p>
<p>57 grams cream cheese</p>
<p>4 tablespoons olive oil</p>
<p>1 egg</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</p>
<p>Heat the cheeses in the microwave for a short while to soften.</p>
<p>Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl. The dough will</p>
<p>be more like a thick batter than a workable dough.</p>
<p>Line a baking sheet or pizza stone with parchment paper. Use a</p>
<p>wooden spoon or spatula to smooth the dough into a 9-inch round</p>
<p>pizza crust. You may also divide the dough into fourths and create</p>
<p>four, 5-inch (13 cm) pizza crusts (if you make 4 servings).</p>
<p>Bake the crust for 9 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.</p>
<p>Remove the crust from the oven, top with your favourite Banting toppings – try the cream cheese, salmon and mozzarella.</p>
<p>After you top the pizza, return it to the oven to bake until the toppings are browned and the cheese is melted.</p>
<p>Non-low-carbers would argue that this way of making pizza is expensive but the base is very rich and one or two slices is all you need for a meal.</p>
