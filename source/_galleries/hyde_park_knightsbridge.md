Hyde Park is 350 acres of natural beauty slap in the middle of London. It is in fact one of eight Royal Parks spread across the city which provide residents with 5000 acres of high quality green space.

You would need a full day to experience everything Hyde Park has to offer - unfortunately time was not on our side, but we did wander along the Serpentine, a famous recreational lake built at the behest of Queen Caroline in 1730. It boasts swans of course. And the daffodils were out -great swathes of them.

Knightsbridge lies to the south of Hyde Park. It is home to Harrods & other famous retailers, grand Victorian houses and immaculate garden squares and is fascinating in its opulence and its history.
