<p>Weather men are a bunch of swine (swines? not sure of the plural here!) They toy with us. At the beginning of this week they were predicting heavy snow for Sunday and Monday – HEAVY!! I was picturing log fires and days off work, Old Brown Sherry and many other wonderful things. And guess what? My photography theme for the week is “Snow Play” – couldn’t be more perfectly timed.</p>
<p>Now the swine are back-tracking – maybe some sleet, if we lucky – three flakes at approximately 2am on Monday morning. Dammit!  So now I need to improvise with pics from years past just in case I miss those three flakes.</p>
<p>So here is “Snow Play” from 2007:</p>
