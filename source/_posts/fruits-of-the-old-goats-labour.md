<p>My Old Goat is rough and tough. He throws himself off motorbikes, wrestles with mad cows and no matter how far I make him run, he never complains of pain. But when he wants to engage with his feminine side he grows roses. Absolutely stunning roses.</p>

<p>A couple of evenings ago he tried to make me come and inspect said roses in the freezing cold with my pj’s and socks on. I think he was disappointed that I didn’t seem keen so this morning I took my camera for an inspection. They really are gorgeous.</p>
