I would creep up to a dam where they may lurk and just sit, waiting for something marvellous to land, an ostrich in a pink tutu for example. This would be undertaken at midday to avoid frostbite.</p>
<p>Well the wind howled and I have learnt that ducks come in pretty colours but that they are cunning bastards. After creeping around the dam several times and trying not to let my tripod be blown away I got these shots. Fabulous colours, interesting textures but the birds themselves need work!<img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dy6grlu8z/image/upload/v1558841865/tx6rkldljkmeogvl7vu0.jpg"/></p>
