<p>My very own homemade sauerkraut and milk kefir for optimum gut health! And then of course the bone broth for joint health and overall general awesomeness! My attack on Comrades this year is 3-pronged – optimal eating (the Banting way), optimal sleeping and optimal training – the first two are easy – I love eating and sleeping – it’s that training that is damn hard work! We managed another solid two hour run on home ground this morning – so far, so good! Got to get that time on the feet. Maritzburg Marathon is only 76 days away…..</p>
