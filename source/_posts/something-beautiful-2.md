<p>Step One: Buy the hydrangea. Buy several actually because the mortality rate is high.</p>



<p>Step Two: Plant said hydrangea with great enthusiasm.</p>



<p>Step Three: Observe zero results from above action.</p>



<p>Step Four: Move the plant from place to place trying desperately to make the thing happy. Repeat this step over several years.</p>



<p>Step Five: Declare the plant stupid and dump it into a dark corner under a tree and ignore it.</p>



<p>Step Six: Wait several more years.</p>



<p>VOILA! You have a glorious hydrangea!</p>
