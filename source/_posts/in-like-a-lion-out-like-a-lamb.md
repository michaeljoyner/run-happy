<p>In like a lion and out like a lamb is an old saying from the 17th century and was usually applied to the month of March in the Northern hemisphere where winter would rage on at the beginning of the month and then leave with a pathetic whimper at the end of the month.</p>

<p>I think August is our equivalent. We had snow storms, high winds and heavy frost at the beginning of the month but those buds are now creeping in against all odds.</p>
