<p>How fabulous is that? I don’t know why my TomTom is suddenly talking in miles – maybe it thinks it’s in the UK.</p>
<p>Our last time trial over the same route was 36 minutes. I must be realistic though – that one was run in MINUS 3 degrees and this time it was positively balmy, 5 degrees on the plus side I believe. Being able to feel one’s feet does make a difference!</p>
<p>Many thanks to Mel, my racing snake friend, for pushing me!</p>
