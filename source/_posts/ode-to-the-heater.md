<p>Livingstone (full name Dr Livinstone I Presume) came walking into our garden eight years ago. He was a starving piece of skin wrapped around hunched over bones. The only reason the jackals didn’t eat him was that it had been snowing solidly for 36 hours and no self-respecting jackal hunts when it is snowing.</p>
<p>Ever since then he has guarded the two self-feeders with a ferociousness that scares the other dogs. They have to sneak a meal while he’s sleeping. Or while he is gazing lovingly at the heater as witnessed here. The look in his eyes is so soppy that I feel sure he is writing an Ode to the Heater.</p>
<p>Oh Heater, Oh Heater, I love you so</p>
<p>Light glimmering, warming, much better than snow,</p>
<p>My love for you is endless, divine,</p>
<p>I know I’m gorgeous but you’re mighty fine.</p>
<p>Not bad for a dog whose education has been cut short by his time-consuming guarding activities, I guess.</p>
