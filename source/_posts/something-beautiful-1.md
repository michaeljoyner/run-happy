<p>In my ongoing attempt to dazzle the running world with my fabulous speed and superb running form, I have sorely neglected my photography. I spend all my free time running and gymming, or reading about running and gymming, in the vain hope that I will find that one thing that will blow my grandmaster competition right out of the water (or at least off the road) before we all die of exhaustion.</p>



<p>This morning I unpacked my camera, apologised profusely to it for the neglect, and decided that I need an assignment to keep me clicking. Each week I will photograph something that fits the bill of “Something Beautiful Right Under My Nose”.  All I have to do is walk around my garden or down the road and look for the little things that really come to life through the macro lens.</p>



<p>Today’s offering is my maroon arum lily.</p>
