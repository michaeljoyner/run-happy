<p>I am a Cheetah aka Cheater. Not in races, but when I’m training. When I’m out on the road I can find 1001 reasons to cheat myself by slowing down – pretty bird to the left, jackal to the right, gorgeous sunrise up ahead. Or I can just stop and retie my shoe lace twelve times.</p>



<p>There is one thing that keeps me honest though – the trusty treadmill. Once you have dialled in that speed, you’re going to look stupid trying to tie your shoelace. Yes you can slow it down, but what I do is entice myself with intervals. Just 4 minutes at aerobic threshold and then I can walk a minute. I’ve now built up to 9 minutes of running and one minute walking, but while I’m running, I can’t cheat.  Aerobic threshold it is. </p>



<p>Other things I love about the treadmill:</p>



<p>Cadence and form are easy to practise when you don’t have to worry about tripping over stones.</p>



<p>You can get a good feel for different paces without looking at your watch all the time.</p>



<p>You don’t have to worry about being run over, mugged in the dark or struck by lightning. And no wet, squidgy shoes either.</p>



<p>So Viva La Treadmill – useful for Cheetahs everywhere!</p>
