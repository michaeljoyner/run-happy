<p>What with all the Banting, cooking and running, I have been neglecting a major love of my life â€“ my camera. I decided to take it out for a stroll in the garden and, lo and behold, I discovered the reason that my rock roses never do well. I suspect it may have something to do with Hercules, aka Shifty Eyes, the very same dog that ate an entire broccoli plant on my bed. I have no hard evidence as yet, but he does seem very keen on botany.</p>
