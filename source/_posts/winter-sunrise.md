<p>Our theme this week – Winter Sunrise. This was on our way to Hilton very early this morning, with the frost lying thick on the ground. I lost touch with my fingers after five minutes – no lengthy fart-arsing around with lenses here!</p>

<p>The highlight of the weekend is doing a 10km race with my girls though – apparently they are going to pace me to a 60 minute finish – four minutes off my last time. Insert * horrified gasp*!  Hopefully positive race reports will follow!</p>
