<p>This is PawPaw Hill. Our bedroom opens onto a verandah which looks straight onto this landmark, named after a friend who lived there. His favourite tipple is PawPaw Juice (aka Cape to Rio with a tiny dash of Coke).</p>
<p>My camera and I adore PawPaw Hill – I have thousands of photos of her in different moods.</p>

<p>I can even see her from my bed – she inspires me to get up, get out and RUN!</p>
