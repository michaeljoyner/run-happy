A quick turn around Trafalgar Square to see Nelsonâ€™s Column and the four magnificent lions that
guard it before moseying on to the Tower of London. Amazing to see the site of so much macabre
history. Next time I will budget for a tour around the actual dungeons and the pits where they kept
their menagerie - it is hellishly expensive though for us South Africans.

Camden Town was an awesome place to finish off our visit to London. Vibrant is such an over-
used word but the only word I can think of for this amazing conglomeration of markets, restaurants,
shops and general quirky stuff.
