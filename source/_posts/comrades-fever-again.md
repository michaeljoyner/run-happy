intro: "Comrades is rolling around again, but for some it is not THE running event of the week. Nearby some highly specialised elite athletes will be facing off in an event they have been training for most of their lives, and I can't wait."

I hate to disappoint the 20 000-odd people that have trained for the best part of 160 days for our annual trot between Pietermaritzburg and Durban, but their event is not the main one on Comrades weekend. Hell no! The event to watch is definitely the Mini Comrades at HPPS on Friday 7th June.

There are many hot contenders but I have picked out two to put my money on.

The first is Jacksie “The Fox” Botha and the second is The Viking of Irvine Road, Frankie B, who may well have a knife in her sock. I sincerely hope they are going to do a weapon check at the start.

Both of these athletes have been spotted at various secret training camps around the country, at altitude and at sea level. Train high, race low, they say.

The Fox is often to be found indulging in a bit of quiet painting or construction but don’t be fooled. He is quick on his feet, has an answer for everything and a plan for every contingency. Cunning in the extreme.
The Viking on the other hand is straightforward but fearsome if crossed.

The Viking also has calves like Wally Hayward, the same sort of determination and will think nothing of smashing a steak as a pre-race breakfast. The Fox’s fuelling strategy is a well kept secret that only he knows but he is definitely built more like Fordyce, light and fast.

The medal that these competitors are going for is obviously gold but made of chocolate. So much more useful for recovery purposes than your common metal medal.

As a runner who loves to watch things unfold at the ordinary Comrades, I will most definitely be on the sidelines of this year’s Mini Comrades.
