<p>As it is held on Easter weekend every year, Two Oceans memories have been popping up on social media.</p>

<p>I have decided that this year, for those that can’t get to Cape Town, we will host the “No Oceans”.  Who needs Oceans? Anyway I have noticed that the half marathon at Two Oceans actually involves vokol oceans. To see the oceans one has to run, walk or crawl a gruelling 56km.</p>

<p>Our event will offer cosmos, wild bulls, mad pigs, rocky roads and something for everyone. There will be a 50km run and cycle, starting from the bridge on Rietfontein and returning there. There will also be a 21km run and cycle starting and ending at St Mary’s Church.</p>

<p>The Race Director will be none other than Ysterbok himself. He will roam the course on his motorbike, carrying water, food, toilet paper and a sjambok. There will be no nonsense out there, whether it be from Macky’s wild bulls or the athletes themselves.</p>

<p>I am still pondering on what day of the Easter weekend this event should be held. Should it be on Saturday to allow for the church-going and Easter egg guzzling that people like to do on Sunday? Or should it be held on Sunday so that we can avoid these activities? I will ponder it.</p>
