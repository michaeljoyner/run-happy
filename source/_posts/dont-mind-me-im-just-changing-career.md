<p>Move over all you sports doctors out there, I’m coming in! I’m just busy designing the plaque that will go on the oak-panelled door to my rather plush office.</p>
<p>My hip is feeling much better, thanks to the ministrations of myself and Dr Google. I have devised some rehab exercises which I am doing at least three times a day and I have added some cycling to my regime.</p>
<p>All addicted runners out there will recognize the dire need for my services. Addicts cannot be told to rest. They need other solutions and that is where Dr Google and I come in.</p>
<p>Now I’m just wondering if Ysterbok would like a job as my receptionist. Hours will be 10am to 3pm. Salary highly negotiable.</p>
