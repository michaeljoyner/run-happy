<p>My Tabata studio is my verandah which faces East.   Every day the sunrise is different and every day has its own kind of beauty.   This means that my warm up usually starts with a run to fetch my camera!</p>
<p>This morning’s camera dash resulted in a new album “Mist on PawPaw Hill”.</p>

<p>I just love fiddling around with my pics, the post-processing is almost more fun than actually getting the shots.</p>

<p>I like to follow a Tabata workout with a hike up the hill with our dogs – the Tabata is anaerobic, short and intense, and needs balancing with some zone 1 or 2 activity, to maintain that aerobic base.   I reckon hiking fits the bill nicely.</p>
<p>No time for hiking this morning though!  Too much time spent post-processing!</p>
