The old saying is true. Every cloud does have a silver lining. It’s just that sometimes you have to search damn hard for it.

I have identified two silver linings on two different clouds lately. How’s that? Only one more for a hat trick.

My first bit of good luck was dislocating my coccyx. What? Yes seriously. I would never have gone for an MRI and discovered stuff about my shitty running biomechanics if that hadn’t happened.

As a school child I was very nerdy. I was the one sitting in the library trying to figure out why the hell x could not equal y while the others were at athletics, learning how to sprint properly and, God forbid, clear a hurdle. I am athletically challenged to say the least.

So I just love researching and discovering new stuff and with the help of my beloved physio it can only make me a better runner, or at least one without a sore back. She has given me cues to reverse old habits and I need to practice, practice, practice! And, of course, do my strength workouts, mobility, stretching and running drills on https://www.dynamicrunner.club/

My second bit of good luck was the Old Goat firing our twice-weekly domestic worker - a long and nasty story best left untold. I have now discovered that if you do a 90 minute to 2-hour long run and then spend the rest of the morning doing housework, you have done the equivalent of six hours time on the feet - a long slow marathon at least! It’s a bonus!

I’ve also discovered that my Old Goat is very good at housework and joins me in the long slow six hours. It’s a good reason to keep him around for a while longer and I may also get him back to Comrades. He may decide that it’s a piece of cake after many moons of Sundays spent on his feet!
