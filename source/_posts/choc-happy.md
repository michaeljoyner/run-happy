<p>I’ve taken someone else’s recipe, my love for choccie and peanut butter and my craving for nice things pre and post long run and have put together this low carb yumminess. It has enough healthy carbs and some protein to aid recovery. Cocoa and pumpkin seeds are also sources of magnesium, though for a real magnesium blast after a good run, nothing beats soaking in Epsom Salts.</p>

<p>Melt the butter and stir in the cocoa, whey protein powder, vanilla and xylitol until smooth. Add the peanut butter and blend with a wooden spoon and then add the coconut flakes and pumpkin seeds. Divide mixture into twelve cookie shaped blobs on a dish and freeze for 20 minutes. Store in the fridge or freezer.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
