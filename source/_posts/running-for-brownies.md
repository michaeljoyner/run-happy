<p>The running gurus say that every run should have a purpose or a goal – it can be to add speed intervals, do hills, run at tempo pace, go long, the list goes on. My goal today? Running to earn chocolate brownies and cappuccino afterwards – with cream!</p>
<p>All Banting-approved, and while the picture of the brownies is not mine, the recipe is:</p>
<p>Melt together 52 grams of coconut  oil and 58 grams of butter. Beat 3 eggs with 200 ml xylitol. Add the beaten eggs to the melted fats and stir in 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. Mix well.</p>
<p>To this mixture add 4 tablespoons coconut flour, 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 cup of sugar-free chocolate chips. I did not have the latter in my kitchen so I stole one of my Old Goats’s slabs of 70% dark Lindt and used that instead – way better than the choc chips I reckon – very decadent! Stir everything together very well using 2 tablespoons of milk if the mixture becomes too dry. Try not to heap the tablespoons of coconut flour as this is what drys things out.</p>
<p>Spread the mixture in a 9″ x 5″ baking dish and bake for 30 to 40 mins at 180 degrees Celsius. You need to watch – once the middle is no longer jiggling around it’s ready!</p>
<p>These brownies are even better when you leave them in the fridge overnight and better still served with thick farm cream!</p>
<p>And it wan’t a bad run either – I still felt strong after my 15 kays, and that is my new goal – to always feel STRONG!</p>
