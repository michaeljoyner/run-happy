<p>Two x tough 15km in a howling gale and done back to back – conquered! I feel really hard core now and entirely ready for a day on the couch with my book!</p>

<p>Please take note of my survival bracelet. This is a very cool thing which should be worn by all runners. Several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>  It is sold in aid of care of the aged in Matatiele. Please check out what Jaco Jacobs and his family are doing on this link <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Matat100/?fref=ts">Matat 100 Miles for the Aged</a></li>
<li>  When I look at it I am reminded that the limits to human endurance are in our minds and that I can always push just a little bit harder, a little bit further.</li>
<li>  If unravelled this survival bracelet makes a 20 metre length of rope with a 200kg breaking strain – a useful thing no? It could be used to tie around your waist so that your running partner can pull you up a hill (or two).</li>
<li>  It could be used to strangle said partner if they get too cocky.</li>
<li>And last but not least it can be used to lasso a wild pig while out on a country run #wildpigsmustfall</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, back to the couch…….</p>
