Despite the constant threat of rain and the odd shower we managed to explore the town and its
surroundings on bicycles which is always a treat for me. Unfortunately we didn’t have time to ride
the “Green Tunnel”, a corridor of camphor trees planted in 1940, forming a beautiful green canopy
over the road. So, again, I will be back!
