<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dy6grlu8z/image/upload/v1558841612/aqppblofkftxwudk2hsk.jpg"/>Peanuts are a legume. Legumes were on the original Red List – a big no-no for us Banters. They have been subsequently moved to the   Orange B list – the list for peeps that have lost weight, that train more, that are not that insulin-resistant etc.</p>
<p>A controlled amount of peanut butter is a good way of adding healthy fat, magnesium, Vitamin E and Vitamin B3 to the diet. The key word here is controlled. No, you may not snort up half a jar while you wait for the kettle to boil.</p>
<p>What better way to eat PB than in cookie form?  Here goes:</p>
<p>Beat 2 eggs with 100ml xylitol and then blend in one cup of peanut butter, 50 ml coconut flour and 50 ml dessicated coconut. Drop blobs onto a baking sheet lined with baking paper and bake at 160 degrees C for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>This makes 26 cookies. Each cookie has only 1.7 grams carbs, 6 grams of fat and 3 grams of protein which makes them perfect for pre or post run snacks, or lunch boxes. I’m going to use them for my pre-race brekkies this weekend.</p>
