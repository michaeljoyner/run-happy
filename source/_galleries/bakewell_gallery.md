description: "Did you ever wonder where a Bakewell tart comes from? Well, now you know. But there is more to be found in this scenic spot in England's Peak District."

No trip to the Peak District is complete without a visit to Bakewell, home of the famous Bakewell
Tart, a delicious pudding involving egg custard, almonds and apricot jam.

But Bakewell is definitely not just about the pudding - it offers meandering cobbled streets amongst
old buildings of honey-coloured stone which house quirky shops and lots of restaurants.

Our Bakewell highlights included a visit to Thornbridge Barrel Room to taste some fabulous craft
beer - and of course to buy some - a pub lunch and a meander along the River Wye which is a
major tributary of the Derwent River.
