<p>The Golden Oldies of Tlokoa Athletic Club are going hardcore. No more getting up early to beat the heat – we run in the heat. Fifteen kilometres LSD done and dusted, hopefully the start of a journey leading up to <a href="http://www.pmb42.co.za/pmb42/">Maritzburg Marathon</a> on 26th February next year.</p>

<p>We even carry our own water, please note!</p>

<p>Ysterbok was also spotted on the road – topless in fact, but just a glimpse in the distance. He reckons he will be our bus driver at the marathon but I reckon he is just way too bossy! We’ll see. The important thing is to enter this beast while I’m still high on endorphins!</p>
