<p>Check out the gorgeous eyelashes on this Yellow Billed Hornbill – he’s clearly using an eyelash curler.</p>

<p>And they have BIG attitude to match the lashes. One of them tried to commit suicide by pecking on the Old Goat’s toes. Toe poisoning is real.</p>

<p>Then there is the Southern Ground Hornbill, huge birds that march along at speed putting the fear of God into any passing snakes. They also have lashes fit for the catwalk.</p>

<p>But the poor old Cape Starling, he has no lashes at all. Obviously he has compensated by getting himself the craziest orange contact lenses.</p>
