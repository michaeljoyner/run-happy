<p>When “Winter Nightscape” popped it’s head up in my photography project I thought “Stuff it, I’ve had enough of winter. I’ll just use an old pic”.</p>
<p>But then I peeked out of the window in the early hours of this morning. It was still dark, so technically a nightscape, but the sun was just starting to spread its magic on PawPaw Hill.</p>
