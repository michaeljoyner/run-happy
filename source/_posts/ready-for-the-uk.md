More running shoes?

There are many things that one simply cannot do and one of them is to enter a fell race in the UK without buying new shoes. Well that is what I told my Old Goat anyway. Are they not absolutely fabulous? Saucony Mad River TR with a 4mm drop, a wide toe box and a madly comfortable feel to them. England, I am ready for you.

In South Africa we have road running and trail running. In England they have road running, trail running and fell running. Their trail runs are civilised affairs where you apparently toddle along canal paths in an orderly manner. The fell runs are apparently the technical ones. Add a huge dollop of mud, howling winds and maybe Storm Denisâ€™s big brother and I am sure we are going to have a couple of stories to tell.
