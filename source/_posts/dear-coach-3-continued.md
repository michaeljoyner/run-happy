<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Coach,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When I first got onto Strava I thought “Good God this is embarrassing – almost everyone I know goes like a bat out of hell, whether they run or cycle. None of them seem to have an Inner Sloth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now that I have been on Strava for a while I am changing my thinking. It is actually a brilliant tool – especially if you subscribe to the premium version and get heart rate and pace analysis. But the best part is when Strava is impressed<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>like this:</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Strava is impressed by my performance I am ridiculously proud – like a kid with a gold star.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And while I am running and my Inner Sloth starts getting out of hand I think to myself “What would Strava say?” and I klap that Inner Sloth.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Onwards and Upwards Coach!</span></p>
