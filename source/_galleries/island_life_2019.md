description: "It’s just a short hop from Kaohsiung to one of the islands – perfect for cooling off with a tropical-
looking drink or chilling with the sea turtles."

Just a few minutes on the ferry (load your bicycle too) will take you to Cijin Island and a slightly
longer, more plush ferry trip (no bicycles) will take you to Xian Liu Qui, home of some very relaxed
sea turtles. What an experience it was to float around with them, snorkel and goggles allowing us to
watch them gliding around under the water totally ignoring us humans.
