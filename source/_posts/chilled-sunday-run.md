<p>The long Sunday run is traditionally a chilled affair. It’s done at conversational pace and it’s all about time on the feet. This morning we took “chilled” to a whole new level – it was all about time in the frost and wiping ice off our eyelids!</p>

<p>At 9:00 am it was still minus 7 degrees centigrade! There are certain rites of passage that runners need to go through before being elevated to the ranks of hardcore. One of them has to do with ablution in the open veld (I will refrain from any more detail here) and the other is running in sub-zero temperatures such that you cannot feel your own arse!</p>
