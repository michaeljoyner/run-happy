<p>They say that you should do something that scares you every day. I think that is over the top.  Unless you can give up work and hire a butler, housekeeper and gardener, of course.</p>



<p>I think that you should set yourself a big-ass scary goal once or twice a year. My most recent was the Three Cranes, a 90 kilometre, three day stage race which involved mountain descents that had me sliding on my bum. I’m scared of heights so this was hard.</p>



<p> Though, as far as my fear of heights goes, I will only really conquer it if I can add the Mont Aux Sources Challenge to my list of goals. Not yet though. I am not ready to be rescued snivelling and screaming off a chain ladder on a precipice.</p>



<p>What else scares me? Mountain biking does. Take a fear of heights, add a bike, throw in a switchback descent with a few rocks….OMG I’m breaking out into a sweat just thinking of it.</p>



<p>So the challenge to myself is to enter a few of these mountain biking events and try not to a) have a nervous breakdown and b) break a hip.  My first step was to get a CSA licence for the year to show commitment and my second step was to take my handsome Blue Beast out for a spin on the gravel roads to check whether I can still remain upright.</p>



<p>I loved my spin along the country roads but it made me realise that I badly need to attend a skills course. The fact that I go downhill slower than I go uphill was my first clue!</p>



<p>So there we have it – my next challenge (before the 50-miler training kicks in in July) is to survive and possibly even enjoy a few mountain bike events.</p>
