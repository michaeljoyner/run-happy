<p>I looooove running shoes and I’ve fallen in love again, this time with a pair of Brooks Cascadia for trail.  They make my knees weak in a good kind of way and I just want to be with them all the time!</p>
<p>I know I should stop this promiscuous behavior.  It’s not doing my credit card any good but I just had to have these beauties for the <a title="Read about the Oxpecker" href="http://www.theoxpecker.co.za/" target="_blank">inaugural Oxpecker trail run</a>.  I want the competition to be blown away by my awesome gear as I step out of my tent on race morning.  I want them to gasp and think “oh my word look at that real trail runner, she must be incredibly fast”.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to reality.  I took my new Brooks for a nice 12 km whirl on the dirt this morning.  Fabulous shoes. Slightly roomier than my old shoes, so once my orthotics are in, they fit like a glove. No numb toes.  So comfortable that I did not even think of my feet, except to glance down occasionally for another dose of awesomeness. This of course leaves me free to concentrate on my exploding lungs!</p>
<p>Brook’s catch phrase is” Run Happy” and that I did.</p>
