<p>My old treadmill, trusty friend of many, many kilometres, has blown a circuit in it’s brain. I don’t blame it – it had to put up with the Old Goat pounding away on it at about 200 kilometres per hour. And all that Goat sweat…..</p>
<p>Anyway, Father Christmas has risen to the sad occasion by stuffing a new treadmill down my chimney – just in time for a week of rain! Thank you FC, I am more than grateful.</p>
<p>I hopped on the New Beast this morning, ready to rock and roll with a bit of speed work. Oh my word, the Beast is EVIL. For starters, the zero incline feels like incline 1 or 2 on my old T-Mill, which made marathon pace feel like a lung-bursting effort. Secondly, this Beast is shorter, which means I have to FOCUS or else I will fall off the back and the dogs will roll around laughing. No more daydreaming and “forgetting” to take the speed or incline up a notch.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, the New Beast and the Old Goat are probably in cahoots to make me work harder at my fitness and speed. So be it – I will show them what I am made of.</p>
