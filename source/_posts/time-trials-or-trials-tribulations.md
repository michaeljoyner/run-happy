<p>We don’t play in East Griqualand. We’re tough. This morning in minus three degrees we did not one but two 5km time trials. The second one was the best one – probably because I had regained contact with my feet. And I just love the way my TomTom encourages me with it’s little messages.</p>
<p>A lot of work still needs to be done – that 7:12 minutes per kay needs to fall to 6:35 and then 6:00. Oh my soul, this speed thing is hard…..in my next life I want to be a skinny Kenyan or Ethiopian man who blasts through a marathon in under three hours. Barefoot.</p>
