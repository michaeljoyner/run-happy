intro: "The day is almost upon us, and the lead up has been anything but easy going. Angry bees and infuriating viruses have tried their best, but nothing will stop me from getting on that starting line, and giving it my best."

It’s the final count down to Cape Town Marathon and I have a sore throat. It could be an imaginary symptom arising from maranoia or it could be real. I think it’s real because it’s been doing its rounds - that swine sore throat.

I am busy sipping on a concoction of honey, lemon, grated ginger and cayenne pepper which hopefully is going to burn the shit out of anything lurking in my body. I am also taking double doses of Efferflu C with vitamin C, zinc, echinacea and vitamin D. Surely to goodness any self-respecting sore throat would pack its bags and F\*\*\* Off.

To make matters worse I was chased by a pack of angry bees on the weekend and one of my stings was on the forehead between my eyes. I have NEVER had such itchy eyes. My eyesight is not good on a good day but is now quite awful - at least there are apparently 21000 runners that I can follow!

I’ve been feeling really down about all of this but as I put words to paper I feel more positive - the mysterious “they” are right - nothing beats putting your thoughts into words. Once they are out there, they feel less dark.

Anyway, back to the marathon. I am seeded in Y batch - there are batches A to Z leaving in 2-minute waves and my predicted seeded time is 6:06. I pray they are right but think they may be a touch optimistic. I will give up my right to new running shoes this coming year if I can just finish in time - and for someone whose greatest excitement is new running shoes, that is huge!

I have been listening to Coach Parry’s advice on YouTube re the route and the pacing and have even ordered myself a pacing chart for a finish time of 6:20. It’s been a long build up with many blips along the way, but here goes - I WILL get better and I WILL run that marathon!
