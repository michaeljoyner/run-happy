<p>I reached 10.4 km per hour on the treadmill this morning and my head DID NOT EXPLODE!   I’m so proud of myself.   I love nailing a speed workout.   I spend the rest of the day on a high, no drugs involved!</p>
<p>I must be improving because I’m actually starting to look forward to these insane sessions instead of waking up with a ball of dread in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>I have also decided that, should my house ever catch on fire, the first thing that I rescue will be my treadmill.   I will need 10 strong men for this operation so I’m drawing up a roster of such beasts to be on standby during fire season!   Obviously my six dogs will be packed into my Chevy Spark at the first sign of smoke!</p>
