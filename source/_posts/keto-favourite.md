<p>I have found my perfect post-run breakfast. So good it makes me run quicker just to get at it! I found a recipe on <a href="http://www.dietdoctor.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dietdoctor.com</a> for Keto Porridge and with a few tweaks I made it my own – perfect on a winter’s morning when you come in with ice on your beanie!</p>
<p>Break an egg into a small bowl, add 6 tablespoons cream and whisk together. To this add one tablespoon chia seeds and one tablespoon sesame seeds. Sunflower seeds also work if you don’t have sesame and I’m guessing a few pumpkin seeds won’t go amiss.</p>
<p>The chia seeds need to sit for a while so now is the time to shower. Once you’re done it will be ready to cook.</p>
<p>Put one tablespoon of butter into a small pot, let it melt and then turn down the heat to medium/low. Plop the chia/egg/cream mixture into the pot and stir with a wooden spoon while it cooks. It will be ready in a minute or two.</p>
<p>Place in your breakfast bowl along with one teaspoon of xylitol and a liberal sprinkling of three spices – cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Stir this in and then add a handful (30 grams) of raw nuts.</p>
<p>Enjoy and feel good about yourself – your training is done and your post-training routine is perfect. Your porridge plus nuts contains 17.2 grams of protein for repairing and building muscle and 80.14 grams of fat which is enough to keep you fueled all day if need be. It only contains 8,78 grams of carbs – no crazy sugar spiking there, but enough to top up glycogen stores for your next workout.</p>
<p>The story goes that the Tarahumara tribe could run fast  for days on a water and chia seed concoction – if you haven’t read Born To Run by Christopher McDougall get your hands on it now. It’s both fascinating and inspiring.</p>
