intro: "I've been getting far too comfortable with my treadmill, one shouldn't be surprised if I run in my pyjamas. However, with a recent visit from family, I have been forced to dress myself and get back out onto the roads, and by gosh, I am loving it!"

Ninety percent of my training is on the treadmill. Various reasons - easier to stick to the prescribed paces, no potholes or rocks and you can even wear your pyjamas assuming your treadmill is at home.

This morning, though, I realised how much I have missed our country road runs. The early mornings are fabulous - beautiful scenery, no traffic and the only spectators are cows, buck and birdlife - again, I could probably wear my pyjamas. They donâ€™t give a shit what I look like or at what pace I am going!
