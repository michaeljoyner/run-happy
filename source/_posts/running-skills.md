<p>Running is not only about, well, running. There are several things a runner must know how to do, apart from avoiding alligators that is.</p>

<p> We need to know how to put our underwear the right way around in the dark whilst not tripping over the dog.  We need to know how to persuade a spouse that spending a zillion rand on running shoes and race entries is totally normal. We need to know how to hide said shoes when things get out of hand.</p>

<p>You get the gist of it – there are skills we need to learn. But by far the most important skill is obviously pausing one’s Garmin before collapsing.  And this is how you practice:</p>

<p>Trot along a dirt road in a nice controlled manner and then when the opportunity arises (usually in the presence of a sneaky little rock) hurl yourself onto the gravel in the most dramatic way possible. As you hit the ground press that pause button – there you’ve got it! Once this is done you can roll onto your back, stare at the sky, and contemplate life.</p>

<p>So simple really yet so useful – after my 63rd attempt this morning I can confidently say that I now have the right technique.</p>
