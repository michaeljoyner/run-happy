<p>It is not often that I like my own running pics but this one I really enjoy. It looks like I am roaring like a lion. “I am runner, hear me roar!” kind of thing, though I am possibly hurling profanities at someone.</p>



<p>Also, my arm muscles seem more defined than usual. This of course could be due to dehydration but I prefer to think it is because I have been klapping it in the gym. All credit to Sally’s Torture Chamber!</p>
