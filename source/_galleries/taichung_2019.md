welcome stop on our travels. Time to indulge in some home-cooking and catch up on our laundry!"

This city has a more laid back feel to Taipei and here my bedtime may go from a cosmopolitan
midnight to a still-respectable 11pm.

We take the U-bikes to Carrefour, one of the largest hypermarket chains in the world, to buy
ingredients for our meals. I could take a whole day to browse this place – it takes “supermarket” to a
whole new level for us rural old goats.

In the evening we bike to our running destination, run, and then bike back again – a duathlon really,
which clearly deserves a large glass of wine – something that is super-expensive all over Taiwan.
One of Taichung’s highlights was a visit to the National Museum of Natural Science. One Sunday
morning is definitely not enough time to explore this enormous place. We will be back.
