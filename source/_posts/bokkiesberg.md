intro: "Bad weather, pesky baboons and murderous elevation, what is not to love about hiking? I actually had a great time at Bokkiesberg, as I prepare for the Sani Stagger Trail."

Despite rain, thunder, lightning and mist playing on repeat and despite the efforts of Koos Hekkelbek the Baboon we made it up the mountain. 473 metres of elevation , most of it in the space of 3 kilometres! That was for me - our racehorses did an extra kay or so.

Racehorse I am not - more a Clydesdale I suppose, only my upward growth was stunted at somestage. But when lightning strikes and thunder rumbles even the cart horse can get down amountain fast!

Old Koos Hekkelbek barked at us regularly as chief security officer for the baboon troop that obviously hangs out there but he very kindly kept his distance allowing for a fabulous hike with great company.

I now feel more ready for the Sani Stagger Trail coming up in two weeks. I used two trekking poles today and I will use them again there - they do help on the ups. And my strategy will be to plod the uphills slowly, scuttle downhill like a rat on crystal meth, recover on the flats, rinse and repeat. And, of course, come in before the sun goes down for a lekker braai and a glass or two of red wine (to rehydrate of course).
