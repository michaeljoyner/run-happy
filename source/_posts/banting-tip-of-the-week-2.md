<p>Cabbage is a staple in so many homes and a Banting star on the green list. I have a way to cook it that makes it positively gourmet. My daughter may accuse me of stealing this recipe but pay her no attention. I have embellished it to make it mine.</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180 degrees centigrade. Find a dish about 2 inches deep with enough space for cabbage for as many people as you are cooking for. Chop the cabbage and place in the dish. Sprinkle some herbs and spices over it (Ina Paarmans Garlic and Herb is good) and pour enough cream into the dish to make a thin layer at the bottom. Bake for 50 minutes uncovered.</p>
<p>You can eat this as a side dish just as it is but here is where my embellishments come in. Take any left over meat or chicken and chop it small. Grate a cup of Cheddar cheese. Stir these in about 10 minutes before the dish is ready to come out of the oven. Voila! A whole meal in one dish.</p>
<p>Other things that could be added â€“ giant cloves of garlic, bits of bacon, chilli, chopped chives- the list is endless. I am in love with the humble cabbage!</p>
