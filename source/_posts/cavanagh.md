<p>Wagendrift Dam, near Estcourt, is the most beautiful setting for a race.   Every year in May, the Cavanagh offers a 52km ultra, a half-marathon and a 10km.   The 52km takes you right around the dam – stunning views if you are fit enough to enjoy them while negotiating umpteen enormous hills.   The 21km is an out and back along the last 11km of the ultra and is mostly on trail.   Truly one of the prettiest 21km you’ll find in the country – especially at this time of year when the veld is golden and the leaves are changing colour.</p>

<p>The first and last few kays (about 3 each way I’d say) are run on tar.  Note the 40kph  limit – they’ve clearly heard about my recent speed work!  There’s about 4 km on a dirt road in the middle of the run and the rest of it is on hilly jeep and single track.  Not a good combination for setting any kind of a PB but I felt strong throughout which was great, and, even greater, I could cope with Wild Tracy and her wicked circuit class the very next day!</p>
