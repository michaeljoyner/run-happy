<p>Sunday means long, slow distance, or LSD for those that want to sound racy. We parked right on top of the Swartmodder Pass, ran down 7 to 8 km and then back up, and up and up…..Guess who did only 7 km *lol*. I was lured by the thought of Chocolate Brownies (Banting-friendly of course) with cream and cappuccino at the top. And it worked!</p>
<p>Swartmodder is the training ground of Ninjas. I’m not sure if I actually belong with said Ninjas but it’s beautiful up there and I’ll be hanging around for a while to come!</p>
