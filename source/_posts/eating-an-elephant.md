intro: "Elephant eaters may be a little frowned upon these days, but if there is one thing they can teach us, it's that we should tackle an enormous task one small bite at a time. So that is exactly what I'm doing."

One can hardly complain about a workout when greeted by these sunrises over the open veld, despite the potholes and rocks that lurk.

It’s a well-known fact amongst elephant eaters that the only way to go about that enormous task is to take one small bite at a time. I feel it’s the perfect metaphor for this tortoise’s long trip to the Cape Town 42.2 km in October.

I am no stranger to the marathon. I’ve never done a fast one, but I’ve done over 20 of them, between the age of 50 and 63. I was always struck by the way that, after crying, vomiting and bargaining with the gods from kilometre 32, once I had crossed that line and taken a few days off, I was already planning the next one. Kind of like child birth really.

Then I got really sick and suddenly 5 kays was a long way. But I am clawing my way back - by the end of this month my long run/walk will be 14 kays, and that’s a third of a marathon. I just can’t let go of it - it’s my favourite distance to conquer.

I am diligently following Coach Mo’s “Let’s prod the Tortoise” program and the weekday runs, which have more intervals of running than what is comfortable, are still hard but I am giving each one my best shot. I haven’t managed to nail one 100% yet but I mark myself at 70 to 85% at the moment. The longer run/walk distances are pretty cool - Coach Mo lets me set my own run/walk intervals according to terrain and I’m trying to keep them at 9 minutes a kay which is what I need for a 6 and a 1/2 hour marathon.

It’s a crazily long build up but it really is like eating that elephant - each bite is getting me a little closer.

And my Old Goat? He is in good shape, running dogs up and down mountains, so I studiously ignore him. He has also entered the 42.2 in Cape Town after telling me he would never do another marathon. I suppose he does not want me to to be the only one lying around groaning whilst flaunting a medal in the Fair Cape.
