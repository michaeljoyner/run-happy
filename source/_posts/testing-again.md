<p>Boom!  My Z2 test this morning showed results!   I am faster over 5 km whilst keeping my heart rate in Zone 2.</p>
<p>So much excitement – my aerobic base must be improving and four months of painfully slow running is paying off. My new time is 40:50,  my previous best was 43:21 – sounds like a tortoise on marijuana,  I know,  but bear in mind that you may not go over your upper Zone 2 level here so I still have to insert walk breaks to calm my heart down.   Not as much as a month or two ago though.</p>
<p>Granted,  I have adjusted my Zone 2 upwards according to my newly found lactate threshold heart rate but then I also adjusted the incline of the treadmill from 0 to 1.  I warm up slowly and then reset the treadmill to zero and start my 5 km.</p>
<p>I’m getting very fond of my treadmill actually.  I know it’s not as good as outdoor running in respect of environmental factors and differing terrains,  but I usually try and do 50% of my weekly mileage on the road.</p>
<p>The fact that I can know my EXACT pace and heart rate constantly just by staring ahead of me really pleases my bean-counter mind.</p>
<p>When I’m not in the mood for numbers, I can use it as a meditation tool.  You don’t have to watch the road – just zone out, clear your mind of “chatter” and focus on your breathing.   No need to assume the lotus position – and I do like to kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Problems at work?  No problem – hop on the treadmill and mull it over.   Things fall into place when you’re running relaxed.  In fact I’ve come up with some most ingenious plans while on the treadmill.</p>
<p>All in all,  I think the good all T-mill does not deserve it’s bad rap.</p>
