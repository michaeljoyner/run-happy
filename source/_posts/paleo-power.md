Eat it with meat and gravy or eat it as a pudding, but when you are going the distance in your training and you feel you need extra carbs, this is the bomb.

It involves sweet potatoes, pecan nuts, honey, coconut cream and olive oil and here is what I did.

Take about 1,5 kg of sweet potatoes, scrub but donâ€™t peel, and steam them whole for half an hour so that they are par-cooked.

Slice them. Place a layer of sweet potato in a greased oven dish, sprinkle with a little rock salt, drizzle with honey and throw a few pecans over them. Continue layering in this manner until you are done with the sweet potatoes. Drizzle with olive oil and pour about 200ml of coconut cream over the top. Bake at 180 degrees Centigrade for 45 minutes to an hour. If the dish is drying out add more coconut cream and another drizzle of olive oil.

This weekend we will be covering 30 kays on the road and 18 kays on the bike and this delectable concoction was just what I need - a bit of Paleo Power.
