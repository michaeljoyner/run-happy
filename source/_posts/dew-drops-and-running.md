<p>My photography project this week is “Dew”. We have the most fantastic misty mornings where droplets hang on spiderwebs like jewels. Obviously, because I need a photograph of just that, we haven’t had one of those mornings this week.</p>
<p>So, when it dawned drizzly and overcast this morning, and one of our Comrades team needed a second for her long run, I donned my coaches cap (?!) and went for a drive, Fujifilm waterproof camera at the ready. I would look for rain drops clinging to grass and do seconding duty at the same time. The winter colours and big skies far outshone the raindrops but there are a couple of drop shots in there (sounds vaguely rugby-ish).</p>
