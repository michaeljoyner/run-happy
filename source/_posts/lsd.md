<p>This was my view from the verandah when we got out of bed at 5am this morning for our long run. The sun was stirring itself just below the horizon while the moon was still up. Beautiful.</p>
<p>The old hips are still burning a bit from last week’s marathon so it was an exercise in mental strength to get up and get out for 2 hours 20 minutes today but it’s done. Onwards and upwards.</p>
