<p>Okay, so it turns out that my dearly beloved spouse is equipped with a 3 litre diesel engine, with turbo probably.   He cruises up and down hills without changing expression or even his breathing pattern.   Meanwhile, I am as red as a beetroot, gasping for breath, and wishing for a stray meteorite to hit me on the head!</p>
<p>Seriously though, this man is either going to kill me, or he’s going to improve my running in leaps and bounds.  I’m really hoping for the latter, as I still have a lot of things on my to-do list.</p>
<p>After only 5 training runs, all 6 to 8 km in length, he tackled the Ronnie Davel 16km this last Sunday with me.   It’s a really pretty course, through forests and vlei, but tough, hilly and hot.  We did a slow but steady 8 minutes per kay but he never wavered and I really feel I was holding him back at the end!</p>
<p>It’s absolutely awesome to be married to one’s training partner, so I’ve now decided to scrap my plans for a full marathon in Maritzburg on 22nd February – we’ll do the half marathon together instead.   It may sound like a step backwards, but not really – I know he’s going to make me work very hard.   Maybe a 21.1 km personal best?</p>
<p>Anyway, in the meantime,  I’m going to have to chip my engine!</p>
