As runners with no time for sore joints and aches and pains, we need to work them into our diet at least three times a week.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I also love to find easy budget-friendly recipes that fit in with the Banting lifestyle. It’s not true that to Bant you need a huge income and access to grass fed beef and organic cream. While those things are certainly nice to have, they are by no means necessary. Anyone, with a bit of imagination and determination can regain their health by avoiding sugar, grains and processed seed oils because that, in a nutshell, is exactly what Banting is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While paging through Sally-Ann Creed’s beautiful book “The Low-Carb Creed” I found this fish pie recipe that is super-simple, super-quick, super-nutritious and cheap to make. Ha! I do love to kill two birds with one stone!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">You will need to preheat the oven to 180 degrees Celsius and grease a pie dish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Your ingredients – </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1 x 400 gram can of pilchards in brine, drained &amp; mashed with a fork</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 1 onion chopped and fried in 30 ml coconut oil</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 250 ml grated cheddar cheese (optional but delicious)</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 3 eggs beaten with a fork</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 30 ml coconut flour</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 250 ml full cream milk</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 5 ml salt</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> ground black pepper</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"> 5 ml oregano</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mix the first 5 ingredients together in a bowl. Stir in the milk and seasoning. Pour into the greased pie dish and bake for 30 minutes. The pie will firm up out of the oven so leave it for 10 minutes before slicing.</span></p>
