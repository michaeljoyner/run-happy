<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dear Coach,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Week 4 down and week 5 almost finished. Only slightly more than 11 weeks to go until the 50-miler. Oh my word.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is what I have to report this week:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Last Monday I managed a 5km PR. It was on tar at the coast and not on our normal dirt road but I haven’t done 35:35 for one hell of a long time so that was exciting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My other small victory is being able to go for 6km on the t-mill without taking a walk break. I can do it on the road as well if you leave out the hills. This is key to cutting down my times I hope.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">My Old Goat is still languishing around with his post-Comrades sore knee. He is very stubborn about getting professional help but Dr Google and I have diagnosed it as ITB. He is also too stubborn to build up slowly with the run/walk method so he’s on his own here. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The problem is that he has also entered the 50-miler. He needs to be able to trot along next to me looking out for snakes and mountain leopards and disposing of same in a suitable manner. He also needs to make sure I don’t end up in another province altogether. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mind you he can probably walk 50 miles in the same time that I run/walk it so maybe no need to panic. Not yet anyway.</span></p>
