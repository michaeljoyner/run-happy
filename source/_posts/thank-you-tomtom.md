<p>The frost hit us hard this morning – it takes pre-dawn runs to a whole new level! I lost contact with my extremities during the first few metres. The good thing is that it forces one to keep running as fast as possible – a casual stroll may cause blood flow to stop completely!</p>
<p>And from Monday – I’m so proud of this run – it’s on dirt and involves both sides of my nemesis PawPaw Hill:</p>

<p>I just love it when my TomTom congratulates me! It takes so little to make us back of the packers happy!</p>
