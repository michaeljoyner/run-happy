<p>This is how I felt yesterday afternoon:</p>

<p>I know 70 kilometres per week is not a lot for a strong runner but for a geriatric tortoise that is verging on signing up for bowls it is flipping epic. But I am sore and I am grumpy and I hate life.  I hate the fact that my glutes are painfully sore and the fact that my Old Goat can breeze out for a walk with the dogs after 32km of trail. Why oh why am I not drinking copious amounts of whiskey at inappropriate times and smoking cherry cigars? Why? It sounds like more fun.</p>

<p>But itâ€™s taper time so maybe, just maybe, over the next few weeks I will think that 92km over three days at Three Cranes in the Karkloof is a good idea. I certainly hope so. It should actually be called Four Cranes and the fourth crane should be a gadget that hoists me onto a physio table at the end of each day. But I seriously hope that I freshen up physically and mentally in order to enjoy this beast.</p>

<p>Then this morning I saw this:</p>

<p>And I thought what the hell am I moaning about? Granted this was 4 ibuprofen tablets later, but still. I am alive and the sun is shining. I am still able to move forward unaided (if we discount the drugs), so move on, tortoise, move on!</p>
