<p>While Fathead Pastry – find it at <a href="http://www.ditchthecarbs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ditchthecarbs.com</a> – makes an amazing pizza base and is known as the Holy Grail of low carb pizza, I think I have found a Holier Grail. Enter Keto Pizza with no flour at all! It’s too, too easy but you still need the baking paper.</p>
<p>Preheat the oven to 200 degrees Celsius and cut your baking paper to fit the pan you will use – one rectangular pizza doesn’t look traditional but is so much easier.</p>
<p>For the crust:</p>
<p>Beat 4 eggs and blend in 180 grams of cheese, mozzarella is best but I used white cheddar. Spread the mixture on to the baking paper on the pan. Bake at 15 minutes – the pizza crust should be golden. Take it out to cool for a few minutes while you prepare the toppings.</p>
<p>For the topping:</p>
<p>Increase oven temp to 225 degrees.</p>
<p>4 Tablespoons tomato paste</p>
<p>1 teaspoon dried oregano</p>
<p>120 grams grated cheese</p>
<p>sliced salami/pepperoni</p>
<p>olives</p>
<p>Layer on top in that order and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes – you’ll know when it’s ready!</p>
