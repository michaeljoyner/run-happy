<p>I ADORE pumpkin pie with fresh cream. At the same time I need to Bant to get lean and mean for the upcoming Golden Goat Awards – I intend to take that trophy, Old Goat!</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dy6grlu8z/image/upload/v1558841905/ggoyoae4blb66sx2ycmv.jpg"/>What to do? I have all these gorgeous home grown pumpkins staring at me! No problem – I used my downtime this weekend (thank you cold virus) to develop a Banting recipe from an ordinary recipe.</p>
<p>You will need 800g of cooked mashed pumpkin – the real deal, get back butternut!</p>
<p>Whisk 4 eggs with 250ml of pouring cream and add to the pumpkin. Then stir in 1/4 cup of coconut flour, 1/4 cup coconut, 1 cup xylitol and 2 tsp baking powder. The mixture should be medium sloppy (technical cooking term!)</p>
<p>Grease a rectangular pie dish with butter (I hate those sprays – we don’t know what chemicals lurk in there). Slop pumpkin mixture into dish and bake at 180 degrees C for 30 minutes. Take pie out and sprinkle with cinnamon and then bake for a further 30 minutes.</p>
<p>If you divide the pie into 25 bits your macronutrient info per portion is as follows:</p>
<p>Carb  2.17g           Fat  5.27g          Protein  1.73</p>
<p>I had two portions for breakfast this morning with 50ml of cream poured over it giving me a perfect Banting breakfast of 5.8g carbs, 29g fat and 4.5g of protein. How’s that!</p>
