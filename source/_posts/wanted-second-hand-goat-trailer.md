<p>I had to load a very smelly, sweaty Old Goat into by beautiful Opel Mokka this morning. I was seconding him on his 21 km marathon pace training run this morning and I could hardly make him walk home.  I clearly need some sort of open trailer and a tow hitch.</p>

<p>We have a lovely route that runs from home to SaamLoop Sale Yards and it is exactly 21.1 km – a half marathon run along beautiful, quiet country roads. Obviously I had to take my camera and snap a few shots in between providing said Old Goat with refreshments.</p>

<p>I also found some gorgeous ruins of a farm house that I’ve earmarked for a future photo shoot. I always feel sad for these old houses that can tell so many stories but at the same time they make for fascinating photography.</p>

<p>Tomorrow it’s the ladies turn to do their marathon pace 21 km and the OG will be seconding us. I hope this doesn’t prompt any remarks about trailers for old cows!</p>
