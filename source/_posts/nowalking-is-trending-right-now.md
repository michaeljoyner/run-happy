<p>I love challenging myself to run without walk breaks and trail runs are the best place to try it. No one gives a damn what pace you are doing – the challenge is just to keep going. As far as trails go this overall pace at Port Edward was not bad for an old goat – lots of  hills but no technical stuff.</p>

<p>Rocky Bay, near Park Rynie, is my favourite place for trails. Lots of single track deep into the coastal bush, with the added excitement  of perhaps being chased by an irate mamba. #NoWalking is mandatory here. And the camping….the views couldn’t be better….</p>
