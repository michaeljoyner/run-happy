Check how happy I am to be back on the road! I’m changing Nike’s “Just Do It” to “Just Love It”. I’m also going to enter every 10 kay road run possible until such time that Coach Mo gets me to 21 kays again. Happy days.

After all, let’s face it, the Old Goat is better at baby sitting than I am - that said he’s also better at running but not as happy while he’s doing it!

I was dropped from the “Mother of the Year” list way back when I ran away from a pack of baboons in the berg, leaving the OG and his pack of little children to fend for themselves! So I think I will decline any nominations for “Grandmother of the Year” award. When my grandchildren can run away from baboons and snakes without assistance, they can join me on the road, maybe even on the trail if they’re really good at scaring wildlife.

Don’t get me wrong, I do adore them, especially when they do things like poo-ing on the table wearing only a hat, or dancing to Shosholoza in the kitchen. But when it comes to a choice between a run on the road (real tar, not dirt) and babysitting I’m afraid they may lose.
