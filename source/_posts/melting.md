<p>Last week’s photography project was “Melting”. The photographer that leads “Photograph Your Year” had in mind the transition period of melting ice and snow as winter “goes out like a lamb”. He has clearly never visited East Griqualand. We don’t do gentle. We’re hardcore here. We go from crisp and freezing to hot and windy, almost overnight! To illustrate “Melting” EG style I had to turn to one of my favourite accessories – the wine glass! Cheers!</p>
