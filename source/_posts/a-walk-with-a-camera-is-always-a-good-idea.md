<p>If you take running away from a seasoned runner, the consequences can be dangerous.   They often teeter on the edge of insanity.   Such has been my life for the last two and a half weeks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It started with a cold, then came bronchitis.   Being asthmatic I had to get to the doctor asap for antibiotics and other potions.   Once my chest had cleared I think I caught yet another cold virus.   Often I will run anyway – a gentle run often makes a cold feel better.</p>
<p>It certainly makes your mind feel better.    This time though the doctor struck the fear of God into me with talk of heart damage and untimely death.  Seeing as though I intend to still be running well into my eighties I thought I’d better listen to her.</p>
<p>All these different viruses really piss me off.  Some are fairly harmless while some can kill you.   What is a runner meant to do?   I think a virus should by law have to introduce itself properly.   It would go something like this:</p>
<p>“Hi, I’m the scratchy-throat-runny-nose virus.   I have absolutely no interest in your heart whatsoever.  I’m here simply to entertain myself by irritating you.”   Or:</p>
<p>“Hi, I’m the flu virus.   I may damage your heart a teeny bit just for funsies, but I won’t be here for too long.”   Or:</p>
<p>“Hi, I’m the Swine Flu Virus.   I am the King of Viruses and I will kill you.”</p>
<p>Us runners would then know exactly where we stand.   No unnecessary moping around.</p>
<p>The result of all this unnecessary moping around is that I feel totally bleh and wonder whether I’ll ever be able to cover 10km at a decent pace again, let alone 42km.</p>
<p>I have a recipe for blehness though:  Grab a camera and take the dogs for a walk.   Then go to a salon, have a haircut and change your colour!   My hair is now a little redder than Duke’s and just as glossy!</p>
<p>And they do say red is fast…..</p>
