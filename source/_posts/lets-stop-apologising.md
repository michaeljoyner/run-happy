<p>There was a very interesting thread on Twitter yesterday and now I can’t for the life of me find it. But I do remember the gist of it – slow runners should stop apologising for their slowness.  A slow runner is a runner and pace should never matter.</p>

<p>We are fixated on pace, I know, and that brings me to the other side of the coin – fast runners should stop such remarks as “I had a dreadful ParkRun – averaged 6 minutes a kay” or “my 10 kay was awful – only just managed to get in under 60 minutes”. </p>

<p>It’s like a supermodel standing around with a bunch of curvaceous ladies saying “I feel so fat today”. You want to slap her.</p>

<p>We all have our strengths and we should play to them, not apologise for what we can’t do. Distance is my bag but don’t give me time restraints. Show me a speed boundary and I won’t even sniff at it, but show me a distance boundary and I will immediately want to push against it.</p>

<p>You want me to try and do a ParkRun under 30 minutes – forget it, the very thought makes my eyeballs bulge. You want me to put one foot in front of the other for days on end – I’m there, wagging my tail. </p>

<p>The funny thing is, this idea that distance is my thing only crystallised in my mind while I was thinking of cycling.</p>

<p>The furthest I’ve ridden on my mountain bike is 25 kilometres. I haven’t been thinking about bettering my speed, oh no. I’ve been wondering if I can do a 50 kilometre ride on the Easter weekend, just to see if I can. No time restraints.</p>
