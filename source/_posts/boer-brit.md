<p>Our B&amp;B in Ladysmith last weekend was very aptly named the Boer and Brit and here is the Boer and the Brit standing in the courtyard of said B&amp;B looking very pleased with themselves. As you can tell, no war broke out over the 52km trot from Bergville to Ladysmith!</p>
<p>No, we did not crack the nod for the big C, but we were very happy with finishing alive, a strong gallop to the finish and a fast recovery. I think a lot of my fast recovery is down to my Banting way of life. I did the entire 52 km on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/naturalphatgirls/">half a Phat Cookie and two Phat Bombs</a> and some water. I find that a little salt taken with the water stops me craving the black poison! Oh yes, I did succumb to a couple of pieces of orange which produced a bit of turbo-boost, almost stopping the Boer in her tracks!</p>
<p>We borrowed two mantras from my daughters – “Embrace the Pain” and “Get Uncomfortable”. We clearly did not embrace quite enough pain so we are going back for more – the 52km Chatsworth Marathon coming up in two weeks time.  Apparently they take us off the road if we do not make the 42.2km mark in 5 hours 30 minutes so we need to be getting freakin’ uncomfortable from the get-go.</p>
<p>My favourite running mantra is “Balls to the Wall” – it always sounds so super-tough! According to english.stackexchange.com it was  “probably coined by pilots whose throttle levers had round, <b>ball</b>-like tops and for whom putting the “<b>balls to the wall</b>” (the firewall of the aircraft) meant making the aircraft fly as quickly as possible.” Mmmm, it’s going to be balls to the wall through Chatsworth then!</p>
