<p>Only 48 hours until the 2019 Three Cranes Challenge kicks off.</p>



<p>My chassis is strong and as well-aligned as it will ever be, I have run the kilometres and my bags are packed.</p>



<p>But I am a tad nervous. Not for the distance because I have done a 50-miler, but this is somewhat different.  I have seen the pictures of previous events.  Here are trail snakes doing their thing – poles are flying and legs are leaping. But they all look so freaking happy. How am I going to get that look going after sleeping on the ground in a possibly wet tent? Not once but three times in a row? </p>



<p>And the Old Goat has made it extremely clear that there will be NO in-tent coffee service. What? I have to get out of said wet tent and stumble around in the dark looking for my own coffee. Talk about hardcore.</p>



<p>And then there is the question of necessary ablutions before 6am. In a crowded bathroom. Under pressure. Without a leisurely cup of coffee in bed.  And this also has to be accomplished three mornings in a row. I am no stranger to the old bush-poo and I have done enough squats in the gym to enable me to accomplish this without falling over, but I would prefer not to employ this trick in crowded territory.</p>



<p>A lot of scary stuff out there this weekend – I must stuff an extra bottle of wine in may bag.</p>
