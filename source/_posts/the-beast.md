<p>Two days ago I would have said it’s official – there is no such thing as an easy marathon. I have now searched from Nelspruit to Cape Town and notched up 14 of the beasts (not including ultras) and each time the marathon chews me up and spits me out.</p>
<p>But now, two days later, my legs are healing and I’m casting my eyes north for that elusive “nice” marathon. I’ve never run one in Central Gauteng before…….</p>

<p>Back to the Kaapsehoop marathon. Or maybe I should mention the village of Kaapsehoop first. It’s well worth a visit, even with the 12-hour one way car trip. It’s quaint without being too touristy or commercial, and so chilled it’s possibly in another time zone – I didn’t check.</p>

<p>There is even an old world telephone booth where Superman will don his cape should the need ever arise.</p>

<p>We took in some beautiful old buildings from the gold rush era, and had a lovely leisurely lunch at Salvador Bistro – a building with a very long history and probably haunted by a bunch of old ghosts. A place where the birds chill in the dogs water bowl!</p>

<p>Back to the race itself. We were dropped off by the bus at 4:30am next to a forest where the organisers had wound fairy lights into the trees to lead us through the dark down to the start – such a lovely touch. It really is an incredibly well organised race – the start, the finish and all the water tables. It also has a generous cut off attracting many back of the packers so I never felt lonely on the road.</p>
<p>The end was really tough though. Three to four kilometres uphill with not one spot of shade – it was over 30 degrees by the time I reached that bit. The big question is did we qualify? No! The Old Goat did 5:16 and I did 5:33. I was very proud of myself for not being too far behind him though.</p>
<p>Maybe we’ll crack it next time and maybe we won’t. We’ll definitely continue seeing the countryside on foot but the fact remains  – 42.2 km is a real beast!</p>
