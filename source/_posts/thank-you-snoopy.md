Comrades Marathon is everywhere. In the face of all the hype surrounding the annual running pilgrimage my old Labrador hips have ground to a halt. It’s hard to accept. Even though I haven’t cracked the nod for the great race, it would have been nice to buy myself a new pair of road shoes and go for a little trot, to soothe the soul.

One of my knowledgable offspring has diagnosed overtraining and forbidden me to run for two weeks. I’m surprised I didn’t recognise the signs myself. Me and my body - we don’t communicate well.

The signs of overtraining are actually very easy to spot - irritability, tearfulness, continuous aches and pains and poor training results are the biggies. I cannot remember when I last took a rest day, but I took one yesterday and am already feeling better. Of course that could be because it’s weekend, but I will give this rest thing a good go.

I will think about balance, like Charles Schulz’s Snoopy. He is always a source of inspiration, amusement and lots of other warm, fuzzy stuff.
