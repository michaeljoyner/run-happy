<p>Our photography theme last week was ice and frost but I have been neglecting my camera so that I can finish the assignments for my Banting course. I am happy to announce that I have joined the ranks of the Real Meal Revolution’s Banting Elite as a Certified Banting Coach – very exciting!</p>
<p>But back to the photography. We had an icy morning today so I snapped a couple of frosty pics but I notice that winter has lost it’s bite. It will soon be beaten into submission. I’ve seen buds on the trees and I can hear the pair of geese that nest on the dam just above the house. They’re getting excited about something. It may be just wild goose sex though……..</p>
