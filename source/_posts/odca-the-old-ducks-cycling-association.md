<p>Who needs weights when you can lift bicycles? Introducing the poster girls for the Old Ducks Cycling Association!</p>

<p>We are both seasoned distance runners and quite au fait with 40 km on foot. Today we decided that we needed to do 40km on the mountain bike. No technical stuff – just gravel grinding. </p>

<p>Easier said than done though – my lower back muscles are screaming at me and I appear to have extra gluteus muscles where I’m damn sure none existed before.</p>

<p>Never mind – onwards and upwards I always say – next time will be 45 km.</p>
