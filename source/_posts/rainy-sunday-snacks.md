<p><span>A rainy Sunday curled up with a warm dog and a book sounds fabulous, especially after</span> a<span> long run. But for me it never lasts. After a couple of hours I’m itching to move around and do something. And that is when I tinker around in the kitchen, trying new recipes.</span></p>
<p><span>Todays efforts produced Cheese and Chive Muffins which are low carb enough to call Keto, easy to make and absolutely delicious eaten warm with farm butter. Perfect for a rainy day.</span></p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups of almond flour</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon Ina Paarman’s Green Onion Seasoning</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup full cream natural yoghurt</li>
    <li>60 grams of butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/2 cup grated Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chopped chives (mine are home grown so allow me to boast a little here)</li>
    <li>Paprika for sprinkling over the top – optional but yummy</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Heat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius. Grease a muffin tin – this recipe makes 12 muffins. The best thing I ever bought for baking was a silicone muffin pan – no greasing required and the muffins just pop out.</span></p>
<p><span>Mix the almond flour, salt, baking powder, garlic powder, onion seasoning, cheese and chives together in a bowl. In another bowl whisk together the eggs, the melted butter and the yoghurt. Mix the egg mixture into the dry mixture and spoon the batter into the 12 muffin cups. Sprinkle with paprika.</span></p>
<p><span>Bake for 10 minutes at 220 degrees Celsius, turn down to 200 degrees and bake for a further 10 minutes. The muffins should be golden. Poke one with a toothpick – if it comes out clean they are done.</span></p>
<p><span>Store these in the fridge but always reheat in the microwave for a few seconds before eating – it returns them to their awesome fluffy state.</span></p>
