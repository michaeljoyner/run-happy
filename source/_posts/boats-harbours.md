<p>I have signed up for David Peterson’s “Photograph Your Year” . It’s not like I haven’t got enough to do. I already need at least another eight hours in my day but I just love the way this man inspires me with new projects. He forces me to get out there with my camera.</p>
<p>So I have decided to add a new category to my blog site where I will collect my year of photos and show them off.</p>
<p>This week’s theme is Boats and Harbours. Autumn is drawing in and many recreational boaters are taking their boats out for the last time. My pics are of boats (or bits of boats in this case) that had their “last time” many years ago.</p>
