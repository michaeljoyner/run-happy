intro: "The Sani Stagger is done, and so am I. Although hard times on the mountain also meant good times on the weekend. And the Old Goat toys with death."

The Sani Stagger Trail has been firmly crossed off my list of “Fun Things to do in the Mountains”.

The first loop went to plan, mountains and all. The second loop, however, was clearly designed by some sort of antelope on crack cocaine. I have absolutely no desire to revisit it.

The rest of our camping weekend was good. Dinner on Friday at Stone House Kitchen – wonderful food with good company – and Saturday evening at the Underberg Spar Food & Wine Show at Glencairn. The big hall was a stunning array of gorgeous fairy lights and groaning tables. I spent most of my time going from wine table to wine table pretending to be a wine connoisseur but in my mind thinking “Just pour the fucking wine already”! What’s with those tiny tastes? All the same, very well done Underberg Spar and Glencairn – it was great.

The Old Goat who was nearly a divorcee by this time from telling everyone that the trail was “a nice walk” bought himself a bottle of Honey Mead. I don’t think it is dietician approved so I will be keeping that for Christmas. I’m still getting lean and mean under said dietician’s care.

This weekend I will act my age and do a sedate 10 kay road race. It’s the annual Save Orion event in Pietermaritzburg which is always well organised and a great run. I have an easy 10 kay on my program so E_E_E_A_S_Y it will be!
