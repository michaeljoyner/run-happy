<p>I have hated porridge since I was a child – I was obviously super-smart – those grains are evil!    But here is a Banting-friendly Coconut Porridge that takes 15 minutes to make and is delicious!   It makes a nice alternative to eggs and bacon on a cold morning when a smoothie or yoghurt  just doesn’t sound appealing.</p>
<p>Pop 2 tablespoons of butter in a pot and melt.    Add 1 cup of dessicated  coconut and let it toast in the butter.   Stir continuously and watch it like a hawk  –  it burns easily.    When the coconut is lightly toasted add 1 can of coconut milk and bring to the boil.   Now add 1 heaped tablespoon of ground flaxseed (soooo good for you  –  all that Omega 3),  a pinch of salt and a few drops of vanilla.   Let the mixture bubble away for 8 to 10 minutes while it thickens.</p>
<p>I eat this porridge with a teaspoon of honey and a handful of almonds stirred in.   No milk required,  the consistency is perfect as it is.</p>
<p>You could also add more coconut sprinkled on top or serve it with berries.   Very versatile.</p>
