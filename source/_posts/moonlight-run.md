<p>So there we were, one of us night blind and one of us with cracked ribs, just running in the moonlight!</p>
<p>The Old Goat has had yet another run in with a grumpy cow (I swear it wasn’t me.)  It flattened him against some agricultural structure and showed him who was boss. He insists on running but I’m sure there is a cracked rib or two in there. Obviously he won’t go to the doc – why should he? He has his own medical (and vetinerary) degree. And he has the cheek to get cross with me when I consult the esteemed Dr Google!</p>
<p>What with the stumbling in the dark and the injuries, it was a pretty awesome run – fast for me!</p>
