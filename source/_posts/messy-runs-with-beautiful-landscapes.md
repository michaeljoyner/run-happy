intro: "Things got a bitty messy on my run this morning. But at least I didn't soil myself, and actually it may have been productive at the end. So onwards and upwards."

I’m so determined to give Coach Mo’s programme everything I’ve got but this morning’s run in these beautiful surroundings got messy.

Drawing a line around something on a pic is clearly not my forte.

Running for 5 minutes plus a bit at a time is currently hard even at tortoise pace. I tried really hard for the full 40 minutes but the messiness started at minute 29! I had to stop to catch my breath twice and then the last five minutes did not resemble the workout at all!

Garmin, however, told me my run was productive - bless her. She so often just gives me a very boring “Maintaining” and every now and then an “Unproductive”. WTF - I need to have a stern word with her. No run is EVER “unproductive”. It may be so physically but it is never unproductive mentally.

The battle will continue.
