I loved Kaohsiung City. As hot as Hades in summer, it is the second largest city in Taiwan and boasts a rich cultural history along with island life just a short ferry-hop away.

My favourite bits of the city though were the paths along Love River. We ran along them in the sweltering heat and we wandered along them in the evening admiring the way the bridges light up in constantly changing colours.
