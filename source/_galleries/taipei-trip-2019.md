Seriously, though, I would love this City with its 24-7 hustle and bustle even if I had no family here. I very quickly change my normal 8 to 9pm bed time for a more cosmopolitan midnight – there are so many restaurants and watering holes to choose from and the streets are packed with people.

The U-Bikes are one of my favourite things and the fact that one can cycle around the city quite safely even in the most frenetic of traffic is something quite amazing for a South African.

And of course I need a place to run – Daan Park and the long pathways along the river, with an iced coffee from the 7-Eleven to cool down afterwards, are perfect.
