<p>The theme for Photograph Your Year this week is Farmers Markets. My nearest market is a three hour drive from here. A tad excessive – unless you happen to work for National Geographic (my dream job, along with neurosurgeon and sausage dog breeder).</p>
<p>I do have a fabulous vegetable garden though and so photographed some of my home grown aubergines as if I were displaying them at said market.</p>
