<p>Dear Coach,</p>
<p>Not much happened last week except low mileage, some new yoga workouts, a bit of gym and spinning and lots of rest and recovery. So that was week 11 down.</p>
<p>Now for week 12. I would dearly love to hit 70 kays this week without any issues. We have a 45km trail on Sunday – everything is on track so far, except for a slight problem with my Old Goat’s foot.</p>
<p>An angry bull stomped on it while he was trying to load it onto a lorry. I would like to say that the bull came off second best but he just swaggered off nonchalantly, the bull that is. The Old Goat limped home.</p>

<p>Today, in four weeks time, we will be preparing to see the 100-milers off at Karkloof before setting off on our 50-mile adventure the next morning. Very exciting.  I am already obsessed with the long term weather report for Howick.</p>

<p>PS I’ve discovered the Strava Fitness and Freshness function – loving it, but more about that next week.</p>
