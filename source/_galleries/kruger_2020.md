Pretoriuskop was our stop-off point before the big trek to Satara. It's close to Numbi Gate and so we stayed there the night we arrived and the night before we left.

Satara is about 140 km to the north and at a maximum speed of 50 km an hour it really is a trek, but so,so worth it. The place seems saturated with lions which of course I couldn't get on my little camera but I enjoy making little stories of the other stuff we see.
