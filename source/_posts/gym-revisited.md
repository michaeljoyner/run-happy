<p>I did say a few months back that I was not going to bother with my heart rate during our gym classes – I actually go to them more for the small-town social life than anything else,  though a bit of cross training never hurt anyone.</p>
<p>But I’m a sucker for numbers and stats – tracking them,  thinking about them,  even watching them on the console of the treadmill!</p>
<p>So I did it – I bought myself a very simple Polar FT2 to track my heart rate at gym classes.   I use a Garmin for my running,  which I love, but it’s HUGE and doesn’t look good with gym clothes – girls will be girls!   The FT2 is very simple to operate,  only costs R900.00 and is perfect for the purpose I want it for.</p>
<p>So what did I find?   I really thought our cardio, circuit and step classes would fall way out of my zone 2 – perhaps zone 3 or 4 even.   That’s why I didn’t want to measure – it would mess with my zone 2 training.   If I don’t measure it it’s not there – something like the ostrich with its head in the sand!   I was so pleasantly surprised – all three classes fell squarely into zone 2.   I must be getting fitter – and the different movements and exercises can only improve my running.</p>
<p>My Joe Friel “Total Heart Rate Training” book has arrived as well so I’m really excited to go through that – what a perfect excuse for spending Sunday afternoon on my bed!</p>
