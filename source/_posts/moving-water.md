<p>Okay, so on to my next photography assignment – moving water. They actually want water that’s moving fast as in a waterfall. In East Griqualand? In winter? Suggestions are made whereby we should get artsy-fartsy with a running tap but I am mad about landscape photography so first had to get my water shots outside. The water is moving – it was a windy morning and there were birds involved!</p>
