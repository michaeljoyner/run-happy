<p>Last week’s photography theme was Family so what better opportunity than a family hike on Boxing Day? But I forgot to check my settings. Apparently you can’t be a photographer and a Rain Whisperer successfully on the same day! My camera was letting in way too much light, making the pics very grainy.</p>
<p>Not to be deterred by minor mishaps, I decided to use a filter that made the pics look like Kodak snaps from the 1920’s!</p>
