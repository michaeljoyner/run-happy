<p>Okay, so Sunday’s marathon was not great – I wanted 5:26 and I got 5:52.  In my defence, it was scorching hot and all those that take longer than 4 hours to run a marathon had no water at the water tables and very little Coke. Enough said – it was a lesson in vasbyt, which never goes amiss.</p>



<p>For the next three months I am going to run when and how I want and cycle whenever I get a chance – a rock and roll season if you will. I need to mentally relax before we start training for the Karkloof 50-miler which is in September.</p>

<p>I have also discovered that playing in the mud puddles on a mountain bike does not end when you get off the bike. There is bike washing that must be done. What the hell! This is a big job. It adds at least 45 minutes to my workout when done properly.</p>



<p>  There are different things to be done with different types of brushes and solvents, all at awkward angles, and in my case, the tap for the hose pipe is under a huge canopy of bushes. This entails a 10 metre bear crawl every time I need to turn the tap on and off.</p>



<p>Should this activity not be recognised by Garmin Connect? Should we not be uploading our bike washing to Strava? It will certainly count for a few extra calories of food on My Fitness Pal.</p>
