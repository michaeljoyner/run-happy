intro: "Run Happy is more than just a catchy name for a running blog. It is my guiding philosophy toward running. However, much like in life, in running the path to happiness is not always as simple as it seems."

This run was such a happy run, as evidenced by my huge grin and exploding hair.

I need to remind myself often that “Run Happy” is not just the name of my blog but should also be both the goal and the method of my training.

I actually have many training goals but first and foremost is the goal of remaining in top form for as long as I can. Mostly so that my children don’t push me off a cliff or into an ant bear hole.

My other goal is to always be ready for a half marathon or a 50 km gravel grind on the bike. I don’t have to win them but I need to be able to enter and enjoy them at the drop of a hat. Or should I say the drop of a running shoe.

I can’t say the same for swimming – our triathlon career has gotten no further than acquiring a full cozzie that doesn’t fall off when I dive.

But always lurking at the back of my mind is that damn elusive Comrades. This year it is on my birthday and, yes, I am that mad. I would rather run 90 km for a piddly-sized medal than lounge around drinking champagne and eating cake. But the question is, will I be Running Happy if I’m busting a gut trying to qualify? I really don’t know the answer.
