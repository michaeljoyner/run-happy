The Corcorans live in Ravensfield, a beautiful little village, despite the fact that it is near Rotheram which is meant to be rough. I suspect that British rough and South African rough are different concepts.

Just down the drag we have Sheffield which is more upmarket (obviously, as it is the home of the
Honourable Kerry Anne Moon). We had a quick whirl around the Botanical Gardens there - and of
course a cup of tea!
