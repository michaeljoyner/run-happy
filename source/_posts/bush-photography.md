intro: "I learnt a long time ago that to compete in the wildlife photography field one needs a lens that costs the equivalent of a small car. And if you want to look at breathtaking shots of wildlife there are thousands of websites and galleries that belong to those lucky enough to own such lenses."

<p>I learnt a long time ago that to compete in the wildlife photography field one needs a lens that costs the equivalent of a small car. And if you want to look at breathtaking shots of wildlife there are thousands of websites and galleries that belong to those lucky enough to own such lenses.</p>

<p>My philosophy now is to just enjoy the wildlife and take a small point and shoot for the obligatory sunrise and sunset pictures. No trip to the bush is complete without sharing these, so please bear with me.</p>
