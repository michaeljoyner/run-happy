<p>My current favourite in the Phat Girls range of Banting friendly phood for sports peeps is the Phat Shake.   It’s perfect as a recovery drink – so much better for you than the sugar-laden chocolate milk that we’ve been told to drink for years.  It’s also a really tasty lunch-on-the-go.   Phat shakes are completely preservative free and made from only natural ingredients – no funny stuff that you can’t pronounce – so must be kept in the freezer or fridge.   I’m sure they’ll travel well to races in a little cool bag so I also need to experiment with having one for a pre-race brekkies, along with my Phat Cookies.</p>
