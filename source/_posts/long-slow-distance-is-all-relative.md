<p>Danger Potholes is a 15 year old semi-sausage dog who we rescued as a two-year-old from the SPCA. Feisty is her second name, and, considering she is 105 in human years, she is most definitely my role model.</p>

<p>In her younger years she would hunt and run for hours, but those little legs have slowed down a lot. She does a kilometre and then sits down to think twice about it.</p>

<p>But she will never give up – and nor will I!</p>
