<p>So now I am only one week behind with my photography challenge. Last weeks subject was “Chilly Winds”. Mmmmm. Short of taking my fan into the veld with a portable generator and artfully blowing some grass I was stumped. Until I spotted some evening clouds being blown across our sky – I’m quite sure it was a chilly wind that was blowing them!</p>
<p>Here are the pics – quite grainy from lack of light but rather effective I thought!</p>
