<p>There was no peace for the wicked this festive season. What started out as a gentle stroll to combat the effects of a mince pie or two, ended up as a two hour hike. This was followed the next day by a two and a half hour run. I took the opportunity to indulge myself with my camera though. Not my best pics ever, but the hikers (both two-legged and four-legged) were not very patient. Just as well, it may have turned out as a four hour hike.</p>
