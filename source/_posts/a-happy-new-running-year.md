<p>It started with wanting to put a border around my picture. Fifteen cups of coffee and eight windows open on my MacBook later I was migrating my blog from <a href="http://wordpress.com">wordpress.com</a> to <a href="http://wordpress.org">wordpress.org</a>. It appears that I have ended up with my own web site instead of just one plugin to border my pics, but so be it. </p>



<p>This is the pic that started it all </p>

<p>I wanted to use it for my Happy New Year greeting from the Old Goat’s Al Fresco Gym.  And you can see that it needs a nice border.</p>



<p>Anyway, New Year has come and gone, resolutions have been made and broken and life marches on. I do have goals for this year though. Two biggies on the trail calendar – 92km over three days at Three Cranes in February and 80km over less than a day (hopefully) at the Karkloof 50-miler in September.</p>



<p>Other than that I want to try and stay focused on what should be everyone’s goal – running happy and healthy, no matter the race, the pace or the medal at the end. We need to remember why we love running.</p>



<p>I love running because…..let’s see, so many reasons.</p>



<p>Sinking onto the couch with coffee and a book after the long Sunday run is bliss. </p>



<p>And how else would you be able to eat an entire Christmas pudding (in January) without an iota of guilt?</p>



<p>And then there is the gear. Each pair of running shoes is cooler than the last……..(What? A pair of pink Pumas? I HAVE TO HAVE THOSE SHOES.)</p>



<p>And of course the feeling of achievement as I gaze lovingly at Strava….I’m always so excited to download my run and pore over the data.</p>



<p>Above all, I love running because it makes me feel alive and strong. Long may it last.</p>
