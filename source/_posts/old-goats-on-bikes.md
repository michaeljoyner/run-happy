<p>Violent thunder and lightning, pouring rain, high humidity plus treadmill. I feel like I’ve been for a swim. I’ve surely lost two kg through sweat alone.</p>
<p>That was just a quick leg loosener ahead of a six hour bike ride to the Wild Coast. Do you spot that tiny saddle bag on the side of the bike? Apparently ALL of my luggage must fit into there. I feel like I’m on Survivor or Bear Grylls Rides Again. Does the OG not know that we need a small trailer for my shoes? And my hairdryer?</p>
