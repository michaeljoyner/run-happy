<p>I’ve been so caught up with becoming the runner up to Usain Bolt that I forgot about my absolutely gorgeous Sunday run.   When I’m not trying to tame the treadmill without exploding my head,  this is my training track.</p>

<p>Among my spectators are several types of buck (don’t ask, a buck is a buck), six wattled crane and two blue crane – the bird fundis say that this is really rare.   How lucky am I?</p>

<p>After zooming, cropping and a lot of fiddling, this pic ended up looking more like a painting, but I like the effect.   As spectators they were rather laid back, in fact they couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to running.   On Friday we’re off to Cape Town to do the Two Oceans Half, much excitement.   I can’t decide though whether to go balls to the wall and try to improve my half time from Maritzburg, or to carry my trusty Fujifilm Finepix and record the occasion.   I rather like the sound of the latter.</p>
