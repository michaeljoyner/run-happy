<p>Eggs are the healthy way to go for breakfast but I so often crave something sweet early in the morning – especially after a hard workout. I am so excited to have perfected the keto crumpet which is sweet enough to stop that craving and does not even need honey – all it needs for serving is a few dots of butter and a sprinkle of cinnamon.  And they are not rubbery like so many other keto crumpets.</p>
<p>To make 5 decent-sized fluffy crumpets you will need:</p>
<p>2 eggs, 1 tablespoon coconut flour, 1 tablespoon xylitol, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, a pinch of salt, a pinch of xanthan gum, 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla essence and 1/4 cup Greek yoghurt.</p>
<p>Whisk the eggs in a bowl and then add the ingredients in the order they are above, mixing as you go. The batter is ready to rock and roll, no resting in the fridge required.</p>
<p>Melt a knob of butter in your non-stick pan and crumpets are a go! Add more butter to the pan for each batch.</p>
<p>Serve with a little butter and cinnamon, or cream and berries and enjoy!</p>
