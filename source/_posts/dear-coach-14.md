<p>Dear Coach,</p>
<p>First a little bit of boasting:</p>
<p><img src="http://res.cloudinary.com/dy6grlu8z/image/upload/v1558841543/ny8f37tyhpkzdq7btylf.png"/></p>
<p>Check that elevation! I’m very proud of it.</p>
<p>Week 14 is now done and I have been treading an extremely fine line between completing my mileage and getting injured. So many niggles have been rearing their ugly heads but I think I have come out unscathed. Taper time is the time to baby those niggles, conserve the energy and keep ticking over. I can feel the excitement – only 10 days to go!</p>
