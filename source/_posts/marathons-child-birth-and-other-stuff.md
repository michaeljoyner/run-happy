<p>Marathons are like childbirth.   Such a mixture of excitement and nerves before the event.   Such pain during the event.   Smug satisfaction and a feeling of power as we conquer that pain.  And then very convenient amnesia where we forget that pain and decide to do it all over again!</p>
<p>The Nike Soweto Marathon was my 6th marathon since the 1<sup>st</sup> March – just over 8 months ago.  Thank God it’s not child-birth!</p>
<p>I set out to do as many marathons as I could this year so that the distance and pain would no longer be intimidating.   Well I don’t think that 42 plus kilometres ever loses it’s ability to intimidate but I must say I don’t feel nearly as nervous as I used to be.  This could also be because  I’m not (yet) trying to crack that elusive sub-5.  My last four have all been done at 6-plus hours.</p>
<p>As for running through Soweto – I loved it!  The course twisted and turned and was constantly entertaining.  I saw things I would never have imagined to exist in a township – many streets lined with established trees, a few nice looking parks, an enormous mall and even a perfectly groomed Maltese Poodle chilling in a tiny little dirt yard.  Entrepreneurship seems to be going strong there as well.  My favourite was a huge advert by someone selling tombstones – “Pay once and enjoy forever!”  I got to run past Mandela’s home on the famous Vilikazi Street.  There was some pretty cool stuff going on there but unfortunately the hill was so steep I could barely breathe!</p>
<p>As a white woman from the “privileged class” I received far more friendship and support than I ever would have imagined.   Thank you Soweto for a really good time!</p>
