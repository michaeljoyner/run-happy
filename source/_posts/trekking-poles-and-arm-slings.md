<p>A runner who is not allowed to run is a miserable beast. So the prospect of having a shoulder op in August is worrying me. Obviously the first question I asked was how soon until I can run. Two months! The man is utterly mad. This 8 weeks has now been whittled down in my mind to 4 weeks – he must have meant two fortnights.</p>
<p>But 4 weeks is still way too long doing nothing. You can walk, he said. Ha! The poor deluded man was probably imagining a gentle stroll around the block. I have started practicing hiking with a trekking pole in my left hand and my right arm in a sling. I took the dogs for their walk just now like this and it is entirely possible. The mountains are waiting!</p>
