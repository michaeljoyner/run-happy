<p>Pop-ups are hot right now and so, obviously, due to the lack of running, we had to have a pop-up gym in the middle of Central Kalahari.</p>

<p>That night and early the next morning we could hear lion around our camp. There was a good deal of grunting and growling so I’m sure they were discussing this phenomenon.  A pop-up human  barbecue perhaps?</p>

<p>We had become a bit lackadaisical about the lack of fencing up until then, but that was a quick reminder that the lions can and will walk right into your camp if the mood takes them.  And they probably wouldn’t give a damn that you still have 30 seconds left of planking.</p>
