<p>Okay, so we know that it is the Year of the Dog, making it essential for those of us born in 1958 to wear red underwear and jade accessories.</p>
<p>But I have also declared it the Year of the Trail, first by entering the Karkloof 50-miler and second by getting my hot, sweaty paws on these beautiful babies pictured above.</p>
<p>Right, so that was the easy part….now for the hard work. I need to get super strong (enter my biokineticist at <a href="http://www.balancemed.co.za/">Balance Sport and Wellness</a>) and I need to build muscle (enter my dietician at <a href="https://completeliving.co.za/">Complete Living</a>). And I need to run and run and run…….but not overdo it. The bio has advised me to cross train with some cycling. She reckons that up to a third of my training can be done on the bike. Now I need to figure out how to do that – I know that one hour of cycling does not equal one hour of running, so I need to do a bit of research here. Watch this space.</p>
