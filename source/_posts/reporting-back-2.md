<p>It’s 14 days since we had the opportunity of running what is billed as “the most beautiful race in the world” and I still haven’t reported back.   This is strange because runners loooove talking about their races.   It’s just that our Two Oceans Half has been overshadowed by so much – a beloved pet being killed by a puff adder, personal bests involving mountain climbing, a hectic-crazy understaffed week at work, family visits and last, but definitely not least, the surprise engagement of our elder son halfway across the world!</p>
<p>But more of that in another post.   Back to the race itself.   I didn’t come close to the time I should have run it in.   First of all, it took between 9 and 10 minutes to cross the line for us in the enormous E batch.   That was the first lesson learnt.   We left our apartment (10km away) an hour and ten minutes before go time.   Way too little time to deal with the traffic – we had to run the 2 km to the start and we only just got there in time.   This meant we were right at the back.   I reckon if one got there really early and wriggled one’s way to the front of the E batch it wouldn’t be so bad.  For the first 5 km it was very difficult to get a smooth pace going, it was that crowded.</p>
<p>Not to worry, I thought, I have my camera – relax, enjoy the surroundings and snap a few shots.   (This tactic is often confused with my normal delaying tactics, especially by the Old Goat!)   Talking of the OG, he did 2:29 which, once adjusted for the start, is under 2:20 – the half marathon time needed to crack a sub-5 marathon.</p>
<p>The other problem is the parking – 2km to the start but about 5km from the finish.   Shuttle buses were promised but after an hour of waiting in freezing rain and wind (and lots of dramatic conversation – obviously my death from hypothermia was imminent!) we decided that it was easier to keep warm by walking to the car.   One small problem though – we weren’t sure what direction it was!   After about half an hour we were lucky enough to hook up with a group that had a phone with gps which evetually led us to the parking.   Lesson number 2 – find parking that is close to the finish, not the start, or better still, take a taxi.    Our third stupid mistake was to not carry money, phone or warm top – we thought our car was close enough to nip back for it!   Lesson number three – run with a fuel belt and warm top.</p>
<p>Hopefully I’ll remember all this next year – I would love to go back and tackle the 56km ultra, but, guess what?  That also involves a sub-5 marathon.   Back to channeling Usain Bolt and coughing up my lungs while the sun rises!</p>
