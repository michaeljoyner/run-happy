<p>Well our Taiwanese trip has come and gone and Christmas has come and gone and, although I’ve written 1000 blog posts in my head, I have neglected to put them down on this virtual paper!   And the longer I leave something, the worse it gets.  Work has been WILD, all that catching up, and I also have just over 500 photographs to edit and organise!</p>
<p>Taiwan was fabulous.   As a Westerner, I’ve always been nervous about going to the East, different language, different culture, different everything.   Weird-looking food, squat toilets, lack of communication……  And surely I would fade away if I had to eat everything with chop sticks?   Well, no!  It certainly helps having family that have been there for a while to ease you into things, but the Taiwanese are very polite people and, for want of a better word, gentle.   They are extremely orderly and everything works – from the huge flow of taxis, scooters and bicycles, to the crowds on the elevators in the Metro Rail system.   No-one loses their cool.   The streets are safe, night and day.   And NO LITTER!</p>
<p>Taipei and Taichung are fabulously exciting.   You can be on an enormous multi-laned street one minute,  looking up at huge modern skyscrapers, then turn the corner and find yourself in a tiny twisting lane the next – and colour everywhere, a street photographers dream.</p>

<p>And should you tire of the city excitement, there are many beautiful places within striking distance.   We cycled along a river, had a boat ride on Sun Moon lake, explored Taroko Gorge and saw beautiful temples in the swirling mists on Alishan Mountain.</p>
