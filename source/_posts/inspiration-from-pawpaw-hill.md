<p>PawPaw Hill never disappoints. Whatever the weather, the views that greet us as we lace up for a little mosey along our road are always inspiring. Suddenly Iâ€™m glad to be alive, out of my bed and able to run, however slow it may be.  Running is what keeps me on an even keel and makes me grateful for everything I have.</p>
