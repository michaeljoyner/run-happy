<p>Purple is the new red when it comes to fast. These feet need to at least look fast as I prepare for battle once again with the Beast on Sunday at the Maritzburg City Marathon.</p>

<p>Preparations consist mostly of putting my feet up and indulging in Maranoia, that practice of imagining that everything, just EVERYTHING, is wrong with your body. Ailments can range from a scratchy throat that is most obviously the start of pneumonia to a niggly hamstring which is likely to snap in the next 24 hours. Legs start to feel like lead and one starts googling good psychiatrists.</p>
<p>Of course once the gun is fired (or the cannon in this case) all symptoms are forgotten. I do my level best to burst a gasket or two and Voila! Another marathon bites the dust. Then of course it’s like childbirth. I moan and groan about the pain for a day or two, and then the following week I’m signing up for the next battle! VIVA the marathon!</p>
