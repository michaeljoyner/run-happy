<p>I hate to admit it because I find it excrutiatingly hard to do, but speed work is where the magic happens.  I’m into the third month of my new program (Mo Van Rensburg of <a title="Check it out here!" href="http://soulrunning.co.za/">Soul Running</a>) and I’m starting to feel the difference.  I don’t always hit the right paces (it’s extra hard on the dirt road) but I’m finding it a little bit easier every time I go out.</p>
<p>Mo’s approach to training is more  specific intensity and less volume.  His workouts are very varied – I always look forward to looking up the following week!</p>
<p>But the whole point of this blog post is why is the magic in the speed work?  I don’t know but what I do know is that when I went out for my 1:45 easy yesterday, after a hectic week of workouts, it was just that – easy!   What a pleasure.  So now, in order to have fabulous, relaxed long runs, I need to beat down that little devil that sits on my shoulder and whispers “have a little walk” and “it doesn’t matter if you go a bit slower” and really give that speed work my all!</p>
<p>And, because I  just cannot have a post without a picture, here is Danger Potholes the Sausage Dog waiting for her mad humans to finish their long run!</p>
