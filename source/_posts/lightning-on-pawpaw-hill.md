<p>I am so proud that I actually did this run at all. The scariest thing for me when running is lightning. Or maybe a boa constrictor lying across the road. Or a hormonal bull on the wrong side of the fence. Or a wild pig.</p>
<p>But I digress….There was lightning and thunder when we started our run this morning and one thing I make sure of in those conditions is that I am close to shelter when hysteria strikes. I did the entire 12km up and down our driveway and on PawPaw Hill. I came up with 101 inventive excuses to cut the run short, but didn’t use them, and I had a headache from worrying about that damn lightning! But I did it and I am positively glowing with pride.</p>
