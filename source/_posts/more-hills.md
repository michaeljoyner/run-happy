<p>This is how our morning started. And what does that mean? Fabulous day for a run of course.</p>



<p>And seeing as though I was in the mood for a bit more nature appreciation, we took ourselves up to the hills of Mvenyane where you are either going up or you are going down. A toughie for our last long run before our marathon next Sunday – we will have to do some aggressive tapering this coming week. The legs are tired.</p>
