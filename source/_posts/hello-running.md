<p>My first attempt at putting in a bit of running after my six week check up – shoulder felt fine, legs felt a little shocked! This was on a dirt road loop so perhaps a slightly better pace may be found on tar. I’m in no rush though – if I play my cards right I still have another 20 years on the road! If I don’t play my cards right, you can scatter my ashes on the Comrades route where I will shuffle my way up and down for all eternity! No, let me get that right – where I will run like a Kenyan gazelle for all eternity!</p>
