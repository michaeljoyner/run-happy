<p>Cheesy title I know. But that is exactly how I got this shot â€“ rain pouring down, a brief break in the clouds over PawPaw Hill and there was the glorious sunrise.</p>



<p>And then I had to go and run on the treadmill. I have absolutely nothing against running in the rain, but deep mud is another story. I am still scarred from recent trail endeavours!</p>
