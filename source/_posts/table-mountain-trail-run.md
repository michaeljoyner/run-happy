<p><a href="http://www.kzntrailrunning.co.za/">KZN Trail Running</a> organises two Table Mountain trail races each year – a winter edition and a summer edition. The views are well worth the effort and on a crystal clear day you can see the Drakensberg mountains on one side and the sea on the other.</p>
<p>The trouble with trail running is that the moment I do my first one 0f the season, I become a trail ninja. I suddenly want to enter Sky Runs of 50km.</p>
<p>My offspring have pointed out that maybe I should learn to carry my own CamelBak first but I fear they are nitpicking. There are several good reasons to keep a man around the house (think wine bottles with corks) and surely one of those reasons is to carry one’s hydration pack up various mountains?</p>
<p>Here is my personal CamelBak carrier gearing up:</p>

<p>Maybe I will keep my lofty goals to myself for now (and I might trot around sporadically with said hydration pack to get the feel of it) but in the meantime I am going to try and get to as many of KZN Trail Running’s races as I can over the next 6 months. They are superbly organised and the website is excellent.</p>
