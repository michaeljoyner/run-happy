<p>As Comrades Fever starts to wrap its tentacles around KZN, I thought it might be time for the Old Goat and I to start our training.</p>

<p>No we are not running – our self appointed task on the big day is to ride the motorbike down to Stockville, cheer wildly for our runners and then wend our way back to the end in Pietermaritzburg, dispensing drink, food, drugs, rehydrate and wiping vomit off shoes – whatever it takes.</p>

<p>So, this is what our Comrades Training consists of. We ride the bike for two hours, we have a fabulous lunch, and then we ride the two hours back again. </p>

<p>And this was our view at lunch today. Hell, it’s a tough life in Africa.</p>
