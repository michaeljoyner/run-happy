<p>Blackie, King of Nambithi, ladies man of note, checking us out. I could have stroked his mane he was so close.</p>

<p>This bull elephant was in musth and definitely too close for comfort. I did feel sorry for the old guy though – so much testosterone and all on his own!</p>

<p>The kudu of Nambithi greet you on your way in and are there to see you off when you leave – beautiful creatures.</p>

<p>I had to add this guy even though I’m not that excited about the   buffalo. Cows with a headdress basically. And their eyes are always half closed. I suspect they are on some sort of drug in between their outbursts of aggression.</p>
