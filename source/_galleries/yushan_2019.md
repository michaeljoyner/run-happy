Yushan National Park is an incredibly scenic park in Taiwan and home to their highest peak, Mount Jade. “Yu” is the Chinese for Jade and “shan” means “mountain.

Summitting Mount Jade is very popular amongst Taiwanese hikers but it seems difficult to get a permit - apparently you need to get the permit before setting the date for your climb.

We had a tiny taste of the beautiful trails within the Park and it is definitely a “must do again” - I may even pluck up the courage to climb Yushan itself.
