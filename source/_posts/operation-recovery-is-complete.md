<p>So very proud of my run this morning….check that stride rate! In the past I used to battle to get to 160 stride rate – Go Me! And the legs appear to have forgotten about Sunday’s 42 kilometres, which is also a big plus.</p>
<p>So now it’s full steam ahead training for our 52 kilometre. The orthotics are in the correct shoes and all is good in that hood. It’s just that when the alarm goes off in the morning I lie there in the dark wondering who in their right mind would want to get up at 2:30 am to catch a 4am bus full of runners and deep heat fumes to travel from Ladysmith to Bergville, get out of the bus, all creaky and tired, and run right back to Ladysmith? The Old Goat assures me that I do want this, very much in fact! Ha! He is obviously just as insane as I have ever been!</p>
<p>Onwards and upwards…….</p>
