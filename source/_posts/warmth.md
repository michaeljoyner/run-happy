<p>Warm is a fabulous theme for me – I just adore warm colours! This is one of my favourite pics taken in the Monsters theme village in the Xitou area of Taiwan.</p>

<p>These lanterns are found all over the show in that country and I even have a few. The only problem is that the Old Goat has been banned from doing electrical DIY. He once set a tumble drier alight by doing a small electrical “bypass”. I arrived home to find the entire farm staff rushing into my bathroom with wet sacks to beat out the flames. Heaven alone knows what havoc he can wreak with my lanterns.</p>
