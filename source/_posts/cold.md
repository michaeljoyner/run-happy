<p>Cold is the theme for this week’s photography project. Even though I did not take the pic, I think the Four Musketeers braving the howling gale yesterday afternoon is a suitable depiction of “cold”! Ninety minutes of cold, howling gale to be exact. Good for mental strength apparently. This was followed by 60 minutes of chasing the Hilton Harriers Road Captain and “Die Kommandant” around Matatiele this morning . Lucky for us it was minus the gale force wind!</p>
<p>I did take one or two of my own pics for the assignment:</p>
